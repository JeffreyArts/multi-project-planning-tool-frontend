# About this repo
You can clone this repository and see a serie of experiments I have done in week 13 of 2021 in my exploration of the Three.js library.
In order to view these experiments you will need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Which can best be done via Node Version Manager ([NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)).

After installing NodeJS, you can run [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) in order to install all the required packages for running this project.

```bash
npm install
```

When all the required packages are installed, you simply run the following command, which will start a webserver. So you can view the experiments in your browser via http://localhost:4000

```bash
gulp
```
